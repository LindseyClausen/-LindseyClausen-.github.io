	<p style="color:#33CCFF">My major is Psychology currently, but my hopes are to one day become an Occupational Therapist specifically in Pediatrics. I have always loved working with and being around children. I was a full-time nanny in high school for several different families throughout my four years. I chose Occupational Therapy because I wanted to be able to make a difference in Healthcare while still being able to have a normal life. Occupational Therapists have much lesser schedules which allow them to be very active in their personal lives. My goal is to be accepted into Georgia State’s Occupational Therapy Master’s Program where I can earn my degree and eventually graduate with a Master’s degree. Following this, I would love to pursue my dream of moving outside of Georgia and eventually open my own practice for children who need Occupational, Physical, and Speech Therapy. My unrealistic dream is to incorporate that practice with a service dog foundation I am hoping to start. This program will allow these children to interact with animals at an early age who can hopefully become one of their own. This not only increases the child’s confidence with new ideas, people, and animals. It also helps the dogs maintain a comfortable, flexible training environment.</p>
	<p>Another main reason for my career choice is my love of yoga and physical exercise and its correlation with the human body. Every human’s anxiety level is directly correlated to their everyday function including their digestive system, endocrine system, and the lymphatic system which regulates blood flow. For the past two years at UGA, I have studied Psychology courses as well as both levels of Anatomy and Physiology courses which has really allowed me to intertwine the two to understand how important mental health is for your physical health. When I went to Peru in 2016, I never imagined it would have as big of an impact as it has. The towns there are what we in America would call unlivable. These families huddle together for warmth at night as they sleep on a dirt floor in a home composed of ruins. It didn’t matter that they did not look like we did as far as our clothing or belongings. They did not judge us nor did we judge them. They made an entire meal for all twenty of us out of all the supplies they had. Giving back to them with all of the supplies we had collected for their towns was an unmatched feeling. Each vacation I’ve been on since that one I have tried to include a Humanitarian element to it. Whether that be giving back physically, spending emotional time with them, or just playing around. Any support counts.</p>
	<p>Yoga is another large aspect of my life. Although I ran out of money this semester to pay for a year long pass at Fuel Hot Yoga in Downtown Athens, I still take a lot of different yoga classes and exercise classes at Athens Health & Fitness. This semester I also had the opportunity to intern for Athens Neurological Associates Physical Therapy Department which allowed me to really incorporate those feelings of mindfulness and meditation that I learned through yoga into helping our patients. It not only taught me patience, but it taught me dedication and practice. It taught me the most important thing of all which is respect. I learned to have respect for my elder therapists, for people who didn’t take kindly to therapy sessions, to children who are scared and confused. I truly believe meditation, yoga, and mental health positivity is important to remember when dealing with physical injuries. It can change the outcome of your life!</p>
